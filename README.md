Abstract

The project consists in the implementation of a digital control system of temperature to a new Calorex company’s prototype of Boiler, company where one of member team carry out his professional practices currently, also we will add characteristics of IoT that allow the end user a more interactive handling of the device, fast and with more information at their fingertips.
Currently, the temperature control of water heaters is one of the simplest of the ON/OFF type where a limit temperature is reached, and they turn off. The current technology trends are to take this type of systems to the next level where the user have a control more specific and smarter of the activity of his product, so add a digital control to the water heaters will be more added value and it is going to be the following step in the comfort when having a shower. On the other hand, it would also represent a considerable saving in water and energy.
This project will make specially applying knowledge obtained in the computerized control class designing a digital controller that better matches with the needs of the process and capabilities of the hardware. The expected results are a stable control of the temperature of the heater, either in the initial period during its use or when disturbances occur.
Most of the necessary equipment and tools will be obtained from the laboratory and warehouses of the company. The microcontroller and extra elements to design the controller will be obtained by the other team members.
